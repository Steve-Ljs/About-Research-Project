## üî•Overview

Welcome to the ‚ÄúResearch Exploration Journey‚Äù workshop proposal repository! This repository contains all the necessary information and resources for organizing a workshop aimed at nurturing a passion for scientific research among members, imparting practical research methods and strategies, and leveraging the example of self-studying artificial intelligence to demonstrate how to effectively utilize various online resources and tools. The workshop aims to cultivate a self-driven learning model, develop good research habits, and ultimately enhance the research capabilities and literacy of all participants.


## Expected Outcomes

- Attempt to master the basic knowledge and skills of research
- Try to understand the self-study approaches and tool usage in the field of artificial intelligence
- Establish a mutual learning community based on the GitHub platform, achieving long-term knowledge sharing and growth
- Guide each member to discover and explore their own research learning path, laying a solid foundation for their academic advancement or career development
